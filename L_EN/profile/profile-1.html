                              At a time when, process equipment, automatic inspection and measuring equipment still relied on imported technology. HIROSE took the lead in research and development of inspection equipment locally, by aggressively promoting the development of advanced inspection equipment in Taiwan. Now, HIROSE has received recognition from major flat <br>
                              panel manufacturers, by becoming the first manufacturer of AOI inspection and measuring equipment in Taiwan. </p>
                              <p class="w01-4-22">With the generational trend of G7.5 and G8.5 factory expansion, HIROSE started the &quot;in-house&quot; production mode <br>
                              and thoroughly implemented a complete &quot;all-the-way&quot; service from sales and installation to after-sales maintenance <br>
                              to assist Taiwanese FPD manufacturers maintain their global competitiveness.HIROSE cooperated with customers to develop customized equipment that can be successfully integrated into production lines to dramatically enhance <br>
                              both the competitiveness of our customers and the technological development of our technology. This has significantly increased inspection efficiency and dramatically reduced production cost for our customers. The HIROSE R&amp;D team <br>
                              has built a solid core of technologies over the years, including software, hardware design, optics and R&amp;D integration capability.We have also extended our efforts to develop technology for the Solar Cell, Touch Panel and LED industries, through aggressive research these areas. Our products have been utilized by many customers, allowing us to reach significant sales numbers.</p>
                              <p class="w01-4-22">Due to the increasing environmental consciousness of industry over recent years, HIROSE cooperated with ITRI <br>
                                through a technology transfer to formally begin a new energy enterprise in 2009 lithium iron phosphate anode <br>
                                material production. We have also integrated spray dryer and mill R&amp;D and fabrication technology with our affiliate, <br>
                                TS Tech. HIROSE is the only anode material manufacturer that boasts both advantages of - &quot;capability of equipment research and production&quot;and &quot;anode material technology transfer from ITRI&quot;. With these two advantages, <br>
                                we believe HIROSE is destined to create another milestone in the green energy industry.</p></td>
